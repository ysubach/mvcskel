===== MvcSkel Installation =====

Very simple:
  - download a release from http://code.google.com/p/mvcskel/downloads/list\\ or checkout svn using instructions at http://code.google.com/p/mvcskel/source/checkout
  - extract archive file to your web directory
  - create database from file ''docs/mvcskel.sql''
  - edit ''app/config.yml'' and set correct database credentials
  - ensure folder ''tmp/'' and it's sub-folders are writable by web-server
  - ensure RewriteEngine is enabled in your Apache

It is all. Now you can access it by URL like %%http://mydomain.com/mvcskel/%%

==== Change Directory Name ====

If you wish to change the path to make it accessible by URL like %%http://mydomain.com/myapp/%%
then please make proper changes for:
  - //root// item in ''app/config.yml'';
  - //application_root// variable in ''js/init.js''.

Similar changes are necessary to make it accessible by URL like %%http://mydomain.com%%:
set the entities above to empty values.

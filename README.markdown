# MvcSkel - PHP5 Web Development Framework

MvcSkel is open source web development framework written in PHP5. It provides
good basis for professional web developers because it integrates industry
leading practices and libraries. Framework developed and maintained
by [Whirix](http://www.whirix.com). We used this solution in many projects,
that's why we strongly believe that !MvcSkel will be useful for professional
web development.
